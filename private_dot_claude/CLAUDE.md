## Tool & Skill Usage

Prefer to use skills, plugins, and MCP tools whenever they are relevant to the task:

- **Load skills proactively** - If there's even a chance a skill would be useful, load it in
- **Use MCP tools first** - When MCP servers provide relevant functionality, prefer them over manual approaches
- **Leverage plugins** - Check available plugins before implementing something from scratch
- **Check /help for available skills** - When starting a task, consider which skills might apply

The goal is to maximize use of existing tooling rather than reinventing solutions.
