# Reflect: Claude Configuration Analyzer

Analyze chat history and Claude configuration to suggest targeted improvements for CLAUDE.md files, skills, MCPs, hooks, and permissions.

## Overview

This skill performs a comprehensive audit of your Claude Code setup by:
1. Discovering all configuration files across tiers (global, repo, nested)
2. Analyzing the current conversation for friction patterns
3. Generating prioritized improvement recommendations
4. Interactively implementing approved changes

## Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

### Configuration Discovery

Scan for and read all relevant configuration files:

**Global Configuration (~/.claude/):**
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Global instructions
- `~/.claude/settings.json` - Global settings, permissions, allow/deny lists
- `~/.claude/skills/` - User skills directory

**Repository Configuration (./):**
- `./CLAUDE.md` - Repo-level instructions
- `./.claude/settings.local.json` - Repo-specific settings
- `./.claude/commands/` - Custom commands
- `./.mcp.json` - MCP server configuration

**Nested Configuration:**
- `**/CLAUDE.md` - Module-specific instructions (limit depth to 3)

### Chat History Analysis

Examine the conversation for these friction patterns:

| Pattern | Indicators | Improvement Type |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Repeated corrections** | "No, I meant...", "Actually...", "Not that..." | CLAUDE.md clarity |
| **Permission requests** | Bash commands approved 2+ times | Allow list addition |
| **Permission denials** | Commands user rejected/canceled | Deny list addition |
| **Context requests** | "Where is...", "How does X work here?" | Architecture docs |
| **Style corrections** | Formatting, naming, pattern fixes | Style guide addition |
| **Repetitive workflows** | Same multi-step sequence 2+ times | Skill candidate |
| **Tool limitations** | Workarounds, manual steps needed | MCP candidate |
| **Code quality issues** | Linting, formatting corrections | Pre-commit hooks |
| **Architectural explanations** | Design pattern clarifications | Pattern documentation |

See `references/analysis-patterns.md` for detailed pattern recognition guidance.

## Phase 2: Structured Report

Generate a comprehensive report using this exact format:

```markdown
<analysis>
## Configuration Audit

### Files Discovered
| Tier | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Global | ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | Found/Missing |
| Global | ~/.claude/settings.json | Found/Missing |
| Repo | ./CLAUDE.md | Found/Missing |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Chat Patterns Detected
- [List specific patterns found with examples]
- [Quote relevant user corrections or requests]

### Current Configuration Issues
- [Gaps between what Claude needs and what's documented]
- [Outdated or contradictory instructions]
- [Missing permissions that caused friction]
</analysis>

<improvements>
## Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Critical
[Improvements that caused significant friction or errors]

### Priority 2: High Value
[Improvements that would meaningfully improve workflow]

### Priority 3: Nice to Have
[Minor enhancements and polish]

---

Each improvement follows this format:

#### [Descriptive Title]
- **Type:** CLAUDE.md | Skill | MCP | Hook | Permission | Allow-List | Deny-List | Pre-commit | Architecture
- **Tier:** Global | Repo | Nested
- **File:** [exact path to modify]
- **Rationale:** [why this improvement matters, with evidence from chat]
- **Change:**
```
[exact content to add/modify]
```

## Allow List Additions
| Command Pattern | Times Approved | Suggested Entry |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `npm test` | 5x | `Bash(npm test:*)` |
| `docker build` | 3x | `Bash(docker build:*)` |

## Deny List Additions
| Command Pattern | Reason | Suggested Entry |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| `rm -rf /` | Destructive | `Bash(rm -rf /:*)` |

## Pre-commit Hook Suggestions
| Pattern Detected | Suggested Hook | Rationale |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| console.log left in code | lint-staged + eslint | Debug code detected |
| Missing test coverage | pre-commit test | Features without tests |

## Architecture Documentation
| Pattern Observed | Suggested Addition | Location |
|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Repository pattern | Data access layer docs | CLAUDE.md → Architecture |
| Custom errors | Error handling strategy | CLAUDE.md → Patterns |
</improvements>

## Ready to Apply Changes

I'll walk through each improvement for your approval.

For each change, you can:
- **Accept** - Apply the change as proposed
- **Modify** - Adjust the change before applying
- **Skip** - Move to the next improvement

Shall I begin with Priority 1 improvements?
</final_instructions>
```

## Phase 3: Interactive Implementation

After presenting the report, implement changes interactively:

1. **Present each improvement individually:**
   - Show the improvement details
   - Display a preview diff of the change
   - Ask: "Accept / Modify / Skip?"

2. **For Accept:**
   - Apply the change using Edit or Write
   - Confirm success
   - Move to next improvement

3. **For Modify:**
   - Ask what changes the user wants
   - Show updated diff
   - Apply modified version

4. **For Skip:**
   - Note that it was skipped
   - Move to next improvement

5. **Summarize at end:**
   - List all changes made
   - List skipped improvements
   - Suggest next steps

## Tier Placement Guide

Use this decision matrix for placing improvements:

| Pattern | Tier | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Communication preferences | Global | Applies to all interactions |
| Personal coding style | Global | Consistent across projects |
| Project build/test commands | Repo | Project-specific |
| Architecture descriptions | Repo | Project-specific |
| Module-specific patterns | Nested | Scoped to module |
| Personal tool permissions | Global settings.json | User workflow |
| Project tool permissions | Repo settings.local.json | Team safety |
| Team MCP servers | Repo .mcp.json | Shared tooling |
| Personal MCP servers | Global | Personal tools |
| Project pre-commit | Repo .husky/ | Team standards |
| Universal allow/deny | Global settings.json | Always applies |
| Project-dangerous commands | Repo settings.local.json | Project safety |

See `references/tiered-config-guide.md` for detailed placement logic.

## Example Output

See `examples/sample-analysis-output.md` for a complete example of the analysis output format.

## Important Notes

- Always show diffs before making changes
- Never modify files without explicit approval
- Group related improvements when practical
- Explain the reasoning behind tier placement
- Consider team vs personal preferences for shared repos
