# Improvement Categories

Detailed guidance on each type of improvement that can be suggested.

## CLAUDE.md Improvements

### When to Suggest
- Claude made incorrect assumptions about the project
- User had to explain project-specific concepts
- Documentation is outdated or contradictory
- Missing information caused errors

### What to Add

**Architecture Section:**
```markdown
## Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `src/` - Application source code
- `lib/` - Shared utilities
- `tests/` - Test files mirror src/ structure

### Key Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- DTOs for API boundaries
```

**Style Guide Section:**
```markdown
## Code Style

### Naming
- Components: PascalCase
- Utilities: camelCase
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Imports
- Group: stdlib, external, internal
- Use absolute imports from `src/`
```

**Workflow Section:**
```markdown
## Common Workflows

### Running Tests
npm test              # All tests
npm test -- --watch   # Watch mode
npm test -- path/file # Specific file

### Building
npm run build         # Production
npm run dev           # Development with HMR
```

## Skill Suggestions

### When to Suggest
- User performed same multi-step workflow 2+ times
- Complex domain-specific task could be automated
- Repetitive code generation patterns
- Project-specific tooling needs

# Skill Title

## Purpose
What this skill accomplishes.

## Steps
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Verification
```

### Example Suggestions
- Release workflow skill
- Database migration skill
- Component scaffolding skill
- Deploy preparation skill

## MCP Server Suggestions

### When to Suggest
- Need access to external service
- Database queries required
- API documentation lookup needed
- Integration with third-party tools

### Common MCP Patterns
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "${DATABASE_URL}"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Placement
- Team tools: `.mcp.json` in repo root
- Personal tools: `~/.claude/.mcp.json`

## Hook Suggestions

### When to Suggest
- Need validation before tool execution
- Want to enforce safety rules
- Automatic formatting or cleanup needed
- Notification requirements

### Hook Types

**PreToolUse:**
```json
{
  "event": "PreToolUse",
  "hooks": [{
    "matcher": "Bash",
    "command": "validate-command.sh"
  }]
}
```

**PostToolUse:**
```json
{
  "event": "PostToolUse",
  "hooks": [{
    "matcher": "Write",
    "command": "format-file.sh $FILE"
  }]
}
```

**Stop:**
```json
{
  "event": "Stop",
  "hooks": [{
    "command": "notify-complete.sh"
  }]
}
```

## Permission Suggestions

### Allow List Additions
Add commands that were:
- Approved 2+ times in session
- Standard project commands (test, build, lint)
- Safe read-only operations

**Format:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm test:*)",
      "Bash(npm run build:*)",
      "Bash(make:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Deny List Additions
Add commands that:
- User rejected during session
- Are destructive for this project
- Should never be auto-approved

**Format:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf:*)",
      "Bash(git push --force:*)",
      "Bash(DROP:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Pre-commit Hook Suggestions

### When to Suggest
- Same linting issues fixed repeatedly
- Code quality problems in commits
- Missing test coverage patterns
- Security issues could be caught automatically

### Common Pre-commit Hooks

**Linting:**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        name: ESLint
        entry: npm run lint
        language: system
        types: [javascript, typescript]
```

**Testing:**
```yaml
      - id: test
        name: Tests
        entry: npm test --passWithNoTests
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
```

**Formatting:**
```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
    rev: v3.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: prettier
```

### Husky Alternative
```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint-staged
npm test
```

## Architecture Documentation

### When to Suggest
- Claude asked about project structure
- User explained patterns that weren't documented
- Assumptions about architecture were wrong
- Design decisions need recording

### What to Document

**Design Patterns:**
```markdown
## Patterns

### Repository Pattern
Data access is abstracted through repository classes:
- `UserRepository` - User data operations
- `OrderRepository` - Order management

### Dependency Injection
Services receive dependencies via constructor:
```typescript
class OrderService {
  constructor(
    private userRepo: UserRepository,
    private notifier: NotificationService
  ) {}
}
```
```

**Error Handling:**
```markdown
## Error Handling

### Custom Errors
- `ValidationError` - Input validation failures
- `NotFoundError` - Resource not found
- `AuthError` - Authentication/authorization failures

### Error Flow
1. Services throw typed errors
2. Controllers catch and transform
3. Middleware formats response
```

**State Management:**
```markdown
## State Management

### Client State
- React Query for server state
- Zustand for UI state
- URL params for navigation state

### Server State
- Database is source of truth
- Redis for session cache
- No in-memory state between requests
```
