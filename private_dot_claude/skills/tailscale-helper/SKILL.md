# Tailscale Helper Agent

## What's New (2025-2026)

**Tailscale Services (GA, Jan 2026)** - Decouple apps from hosting devices with stable TailVIPs and MagicDNS names. Define services via API or admin console with virtual IPs auto-accepted across platforms.

**Peer Relays (Beta, Oct 2025)** - Use tailnet nodes as high-throughput relay servers when direct connections fail. Throughput approaches direct connections; orders of magnitude faster than managed DERP relays. Two free peer relays on all plans. Requires v1.86+.

**Tailnet Lock (GA, Jun 2025)** - Verify that only trusted nodes join the tailnet via cryptographic signing. Shifts trust from Tailscale coordination server to your own signing nodes.

**Grants (GA, May 2025)** - Unified network and application-layer access controls replacing traditional ACLs. Combine network rules with app capabilities in a single policy.

**Visual Policy Editor (GA, Oct 2025)** - Graphical ACL management in the admin console.

**4via6 Subnet Routers (GA, Jan 2025)** - Handle overlapping IPv4 subnets by mapping them through IPv6.

**Fast User Switching (GA, Jan 2025)** - Switch between multiple Tailscale accounts on a single device.

**Node Key Sealing (GA, v1.90)** - Hardware-backed node key protection on Linux, Windows, and macOS using TPM.

**v1.94 Highlights:** Workload identity tokens auto-generated, Peer Relay performance improvements, container/K8s Operator updates.

**v1.92 Highlights:** State file encryption, TPM attestation defaults, K8s workload identity federation, Funnel/Serve PROXY protocol support, network flow logs auto-recording.

## Overview

Tailscale is a WireGuard-based mesh VPN that creates a secure overlay network (tailnet) connecting devices across any network topology. Every device gets a stable Tailscale IP from the CGNAT range (`100.64.0.0/10`) that persists regardless of physical location. Tailscale handles NAT traversal, key management, and peer discovery automatically through a coordination server, while all data flows directly between devices via encrypted WireGuard tunnels.

## Key Features

### MagicDNS
Automatically registers DNS names for tailnet devices. Access machines by hostname (`ssh user@myserver`) instead of IP. Full domain: `<machine>.<tailnet-name>.ts.net`. Enabled by default for new tailnets.

### Tailscale SSH
Replace SSH key management with identity-based access. Run `tailscale set --ssh` on destination, configure SSH ACLs in policy file. Supports check mode requiring periodic re-authentication.

### Funnel
Expose local services to the public internet through encrypted relay. Limited to ports 443, 8443, and 10000. Traffic is end-to-end encrypted through Funnel relay servers.

### Serve
Share local services within the tailnet. Supports reverse proxy, file serving, static text, and TCP forwarding. Auto-provisions HTTPS certificates. Use `-bg` flag for persistence across reboots.

### Taildrop
Peer-to-peer encrypted file transfer between tailnet devices. Send with `tailscale file cp`, receive with `tailscale file get`.

### Exit Nodes
Route all internet traffic through a designated tailnet device. Use for travel security, geo-access, or compliance. Supports Mullvad exit nodes for commercial VPN integration.

### Subnet Routers
Extend tailnet to devices without Tailscale installed. Advertise routes with `tailscale set --advertise-routes=<cidr>`, approve in admin console or via autoApprovers.

### Peer Relays
Client-to-client relay fallback when direct connections fail. Higher throughput than DERP relays. Configure with `tailscale set --advertise-peer-relay`.

### Tailscale Services
Define stable virtual services with TailVIPs and MagicDNS names, independent of hosting devices. Supports high availability and granular access controls.

## Docker & Containers

```bash
# Pull official image
docker pull tailscale/tailscale:latest

# Run with auth key
docker run -d \
  -e TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-... \
  -e TS_HOSTNAME=my-container \
  -e TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale \
  -v ts-state:/var/lib/tailscale \
  tailscale/tailscale:latest
```

Key environment variables: `TS_AUTHKEY`, `TS_HOSTNAME`, `TS_STATE_DIR`, `TS_ROUTES`, `TS_USERSPACE`, `TS_EXTRA_ARGS`, `TS_ACCEPT_DNS`, `TS_ENABLE_HEALTH_CHECK`, `TS_ENABLE_METRICS`.

Use sidecar pattern with `network_mode: service:tailscale` for other containers.

## ACL Policy Basics

```jsonc
{
  // Groups for role-based access
  "groups": {
    "group:engineering": ["user@example.com"]
  },
  // Tag ownership
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:server": ["group:engineering"]
  },
  // Access rules (deny-by-default)
  "acls": [
    {"action": "accept", "src": ["group:engineering"], "dst": ["tag:server:*"]}
  ],
  // SSH access
  "ssh": [
    {"action": "accept", "src": ["group:engineering"], "dst": ["tag:server"], "users": ["root"]}
  ],
  // Auto-approve routes
  "autoApprovers": {
    "routes": {"10.0.0.0/8": ["tag:server"]},
    "exitNode": ["tag:server"]
  }
}
```

Use huJSON format (comments and trailing commas allowed). Grants are the recommended modern alternative to ACLs.
